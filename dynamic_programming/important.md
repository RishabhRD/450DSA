## 15.cc : Longest Increasing subsequence

We do O(n log n) solution instead of O(n^2) with replacing big elements by
smaller elements in sorted order.

## 18.cc : Maximum sum increasing subsequence

It is important to note that sum should be set to current element if greater
sum is not possible to reset the sum.
