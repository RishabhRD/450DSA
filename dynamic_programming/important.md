# Important

## 15.cc : Longest Increasing subsequence

We do O(n log n) solution instead of O(n^2) with replacing big elements by
smaller elements in sorted order.

## 18.cc : Maximum sum increasing subsequence

It is important to note that sum should be set to current element if greater
sum is not possible to reset the sum.

## 22.cc : Egg dropping problem

We minimze attempt in this problem. Here we break problem for the worst  case
if egg breaks and if it doesn't. Then we take minimum of it.

## 23.cc : Max chain length

It is like LIS but we need to sort first basis on first element of pair because
subsequence is not given in question.
