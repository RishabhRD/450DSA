# Important questions

## 1.cc : reverse a linked list of k parts

This takes a good recursion. Read it. It is very Important.

## 3.cc : Remove loop in linked list

Very important with floyd cycle detection algorithm with slow and fast ptr.
To remove link, we count number of ele in loop. From start we take two pointers
head and head + k (k is #ele in loop). We move them in same pace. And where
they meet is where the loop start. And them we move second ptr again till
next is first to get last of loop. And then we set it to nullptr.

# 12.cc : Merge sort of linked list

Very important. Can be done in O(n log n).

## 32.cc : Delete increasing node in right

Very important. How reversing the linked list sometimes help a lot in
decreasing time complexity.

## 34.cc : nth ele from last

Use of two pointers in different way is illustrated
