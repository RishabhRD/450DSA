## 1.cc : Deletion in BST

Very importnat. Need to remember itself sometimes. Practice to code it
faster with remembering transplant and successor operations.

## 4.cc : Check for BST

Good use of passing min and max. PostOrder traversal is used.

## 5.cc : Inorder successor of all nodes

## 12.cc : kth smallest ele using morris traversal

Morris traversal can give you inorder traversal in O(1) space.

## 16.cc : Least greater on right

Importnat as we can do this using BST. Insert from right to left and get
inorder successor while insertion. Code is beutifully written by me. So, look
at it. If using balanced BST then it could be done in O(nlogn) itself.
