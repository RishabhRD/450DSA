## 1.cc : Deletion in BST

Very importnat. Need to remember itself sometimes. Practice to code it
faster with remembering transplant and successor operations.

## 4.cc : Check for BST

Good use of passing min and max. PostOrder traversal is used.

## 5.cc : Inorder successor of all nodes

## 12.cc : kth smallest ele using morris traversal

Morris traversal can give you inorder traversal in O(1) space.
