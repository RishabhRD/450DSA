7.cc : Majority element

Here moore's voting algorithm is used for getting solution in O(1). Main idea
is this: If element is majority, then there must be any element whose count
of occurance - count of non-occurance return > 0. Also a check needs to be done
if the element returned is really majority because last index is not checked in
case of no majority.
