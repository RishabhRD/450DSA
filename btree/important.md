# Important Questions

## 12.cc : Zig-Zag traversal

Good use of 2 stacks for level order traversal.

## 14.cc : Diagonal traversal of binary tree

Preorder traversal with variant of vertical traversal is mixed.

## 15.cc : Boundary order traversal

It's a good problem to see how to break subproblem in tree.

## 19.cc : Build tree from inorder and preorder traversal

Good recursion and logic. Leftmost of preorder is root. Search that in
inorder. left of search would left of root and right of search would be right
of root.

## 20.cc : Minimum number of swaps to convert to BST

Inorder of BST is sorted. Make Inorder of tree. Make sort of tree.
Make minimum number of swaps to make array sorted.

## 24.cc : Check if 2 trees are mirror or not

Can use hash map of stack or vector of stack and vector of queue to solve the
problem.

## 27.cc : Largest subtree

Very important as it can lead to incorrect solution in interview.

## 30.cc : LCA

Good 1 traversal approach is possible.

## 31.cc : LCA

Min distance between 2 nodes.
